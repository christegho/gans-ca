Code for training a GAN.  

This code is for the project [When Legacies Become Debts](https://mosaicrooms.org/when-legacies-become-debts-about-the-artworks/), at the Mosaics Room in London. The code produces image shots of installation of contemporary art, for a visual essay that explores mobility in the art world and how it meets political fictions.

To extract images of contemporary art installations from web archives, I used the code in `download_images.ipynb`.

Some of the code for the training comes from <https://github.com/mdcramer/DCGAN-Face-Generation>.
